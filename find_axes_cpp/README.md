# Find axes using Hough Transform 

This program aims to find the axes of the tetrapods using the points detected before via the Iterative Hough Transform algorithm.

## Input 

- point_cloud_tetrapod_model_1_0.dat : points that are likely to belong to the axes 

## Output 

- axes_model_.dat : axes found inside the tetrapod (direction and center of mass)
