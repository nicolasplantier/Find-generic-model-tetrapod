# Create Generic Model 

This algorithm finds the generic model of tetrapods. 

## Input 
- `main_axes` : the main axes of the tetrapods 
- `model_with_feet_.las` : the tetrapods instances 

## Output 
- `new_fit_.csv` : the overlay of multiple tetrapods. These csv files need to be concatenate to give the final density model.
