# Watershed Algorithm

This program implements the watershed algorithm. 

## Input 

- tables_images : where we find the scalar fied that comes from edges_calculator = 2D images corresponding to the flatness_measure

## Output 

- tetrapods_mask_all : for each tetrapod = an image where ones correspond to the pixels where the tetrapod is and zeros where it is not.
